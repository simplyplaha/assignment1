To run the program:

1. Import cars.sql to MyPhpAdmin and change the SQL connection code in autombile-list.php and automobile-edit.php to reflect differences in the password.
2. Since I am using XAMPP as my PHP development environment, I have my files stored in xammp->htdocs so to run the program I just type localhost/automobile-list.php in my web browser (Google Chrome).
