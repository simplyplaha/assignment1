To run the program:

1. Import cars.sql to MyPhpAdmin and change the SQL connection code in autombile-list.php and automobile-edit.php to reflect differences in the password.
2. Since I am using XAMPP as my PHP development environment, I have my files stored in xammp->htdocs so to run the program I just type localhost/automobile-list.php in my web browser (Google Chrome).

How the program works

The program shows the database in a table format. The user can click the edit button on any of the entries to edit the database. The user can then query the database by entering the automobile id then clicking the query button. Once the query button is clicked, the results are shown in the textbox fields and can be easily edited and updated by clicking the save button. The user can also add new entries by leaving the automobile id field blank and entering the other required fields and clicking save.
